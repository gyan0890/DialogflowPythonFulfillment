# DialogflowPythonFulfillment
This github repository consists of fulfillment code that has been written for Dialogflow using Python. Here are the pre-requisites to perform fulfillment using Python for Dialogflow using the given code:
1. Create an account on Dialogflow
2. Create a new agent(name it something on the lines of TripPlanner) on Dialogflow and under settings, import the TripPlanner.zip - this will import all the entities and intents into the newly created agent
3. Install Ngrok on your system (follow the instructions given on the ngrok website to install your ngrok key as well). Here is the ngrok link to get started:
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started
4. Install Python on your system and install Flask for Python
5. Run the given Python file 
6. Go to the folder where you have installed ngrok and perform: ./ngrok http 5000. Take the https://... URL generated by ngrok
7. In your Dialogflow agent, go to fulfillment and Enable the Webhook(Option 1). Paste the above ngrok URL/webhooksample in the given space for URL
8. You can now save and run the dialogflow agent and you will see a response from the python code that you have written :)!
